Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts of Reaction Kinetics

2.1 Introduction to Chemical Kinetics

Chemical kinetics is the study of reaction rates and the factors that influence them. Understanding kinetics is essential for predicting reaction behavior and optimizing reaction conditions.

Rate Laws:
- Rate = k[A]^m[B]^n
- k = rate constant
- m, n = reaction orders
- Overall order = m + n

2.2 Reaction Order and Molecularity

Zero-Order Reactions:
- Rate = k (independent of concentration)
- [A] = [A]₀ - kt
- Half-life: t₁/₂ = [A]₀/2k
- Examples: enzyme-catalyzed reactions at saturation

First-Order Reactions:
- Rate = k[A]
- ln[A] = ln[A]₀ - kt
- Half-life: t₁/₂ = 0.693/k
- Examples: radioactive decay, SN1 reactions

Second-Order Reactions:
- Rate = k[A]² or Rate = k[A][B]
- 1/[A] = 1/[A]₀ + kt
- Half-life: t₁/₂ = 1/k[A]₀
- Examples: SN2 reactions, dimerization

2.3 Temperature Dependence

Arrhenius Equation:
- k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)
- ln k = ln A - Ea/RT
- Ea = activation energy
- A = pre-exponential factor

Activation Energy:
- Minimum energy required for reaction
- Determines temperature sensitivity
- Can be calculated from rate data at different temperatures

2.4 Reaction Mechanisms and Rate-Determining Steps

Elementary Reactions:
- Single-step reactions
- Molecularity equals reaction order
- Rate law directly reflects stoichiometry

Complex Reactions:
- Multiple elementary steps
- Rate-determining step controls overall rate
- Steady-state approximation for intermediates

2.5 Catalysis

Homogeneous Catalysis:
- Catalyst in same phase as reactants
- Enzymes, acid-base catalysis
- Lower activation energy pathway

Heterogeneous Catalysis:
- Catalyst in different phase
- Surface reactions, metal catalysts
- Adsorption and desorption steps

2.6 Kinetic vs. Thermodynamic Control

Kinetic Control:
- Product distribution determined by rates
- Lower activation energy pathway favored
- Temperature and catalyst effects

Thermodynamic Control:
- Product distribution determined by equilibrium
- More stable product favored
- Temperature effects on equilibrium

2.7 Experimental Methods

Initial Rate Method:
- Measure rates at different concentrations
- Determine reaction orders
- Calculate rate constants

Integrated Rate Laws:
- Plot concentration vs. time
- Linear plots indicate reaction order
- Slope gives rate constant

Summary:
Kinetic analysis provides insights into reaction mechanisms and allows prediction of reaction behavior under different conditions. Key concepts include rate laws, temperature dependence, and the distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic control.
