# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence System

## Methodology Overview

Our system implements a **persona-driven document intelligence** approach that extracts and prioritizes relevant content from PDF collections based on specific user personas and their job-to-be-done requirements. The methodology combines rule-based text processing with semantic analysis to deliver contextually relevant results.

## Core Architecture

### 1. **Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline**
- **Text Extraction**: Uses PyPDF2 for robust PDF text extraction with page-level granularity
- **Section Identification**: Implements pattern-based section detection using regex patterns for headers, titles, and structural elements
- **Content Analysis**: Applies persona-specific keyword extraction and relevance scoring
- **Ranking System**: Uses weighted scoring based on task relevance, content quality, and structural importance

### 2. **Persona-Aware Content Processing**
The system dynamically adapts its analysis based on the specified persona:
- **Academic Researcher**: Focuses on methodologies, datasets, benchmarks, and experimental results
- **Business Analyst**: Prioritizes financial data, trends, market positioning, and strategic insights
- **Student**: Emphasizes key concepts, definitions, examples, and exam-relevant content
- **Travel Planner**: Targets practical information, recommendations, and actionable insights

### 3. **Job-to-Be-Done Contextualization**
Each analysis is tailored to the specific task requirements:
- **Literature Review**: Extracts comparative analyses, methodology comparisons, and research gaps
- **Financial Analysis**: Identifies revenue trends, investment patterns, and competitive positioning
- **Exam Preparation**: Focuses on fundamental concepts, mechanisms, and key learning objectives

## Technical Implementation

### **Text Processing Strategy**
- **Section Extraction**: Uses multiple regex patterns to identify document sections (headers, numbered lists, title case)
- **Content Refinement**: Implements text cleaning, length optimization, and relevance filtering
- **Importance Scoring**: Calculates relevance scores based on keyword density, section position, and content quality

### **Output Generation**
- **Structured JSON**: Produces standardized output with metadata, extracted sections, and subsection analysis
- **Importance Ranking**: Provides stack-ranked sections based on persona and task relevance
- **Granular Analysis**: Delivers refined text extracts with page-level precision

## Performance Optimization

### **CPU-Only Processing**
- Eliminates GPU dependencies for universal deployment
- Optimized for sub-60-second processing of 3-5 document collections
- Memory-efficient text processing with streaming capabilities

### **Model Size Compliance**
- Uses lightweight PyPDF2 library (< 50MB)
- Minimal dependencies to stay under 1GB total footprint
- Efficient text processing without heavy ML models

## Validation and Testing

The system has been validated across three diverse test cases:
1. **Academic Research**: Successfully processed 4 research papers on Graph Neural Networks
2. **Business Analysis**: Analyzed 3 annual reports for investment insights
3. **Educational Content**: Extracted key concepts from 5 chemistry textbook chapters

Each test case demonstrates the system's ability to adapt to different domains while maintaining consistent output quality and processing performance.
